Skills stuff.

For each practice problem, if present:
- pyqt5-w-designer: Used Python and PyQt5; Qt Designer used
- pyqt5-no-designer: Used Python and PyQt5; Qt Designer not used
- qtcpp: Used Qt (the actual one)

Note that SkillsUSA:
- does not permit use of online documentation
- does not (appear to) permit Python; only C++, Java, VB
- uses pseudocode for its written protion
- and does not permit "drag-and-drop" (not sure for NV?) programs to aid in UI design

i'm not good enough yet to fulfill any of the above lol
